Installation of NativeSolid code

Comments :
*You will need CMAKE installed (~sudo apt-get install cmake)

1. Create and go to the build folder
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build 
   and check that it is empty. If not : 
	$ rm -r *
2. Execute : 
	$ cmake ..  
   for configuration.
3. If no error, execute : 
	$ make  (you can do : $ make -j numthreads  , for multi-threads compilation)
4. Set your environment variable in you .bashrc file as :
	export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_PATH/NativeSolid/bin
